# Project U üçé

Project U is a nutrition logging app developed by Roman Wernsing, Dallin Hooper, and Roman Olsen. The team of 3 used Vue as their frontend framework and a Node/Express backend. Users can sign up and find their foods (either ingredients or recipes), powered by the Spoonacular API, and log them for the day. Each day has a list of foods they logged and checks to see if their calorie goal was met. Other nutritional information is included as well.

They worked on this together at CodeWorks. This was their [pitch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sF6CB3HHZDSkuydyCobKx6NnWcI_YhRk2OejvtTISKU/edit?usp=sharing).
